"""
Given a sorted array arr[] of size n and an element x to be searched in it. Return index of x if it is present in array else return -1.

Fibonacci Search divides given array in unequal parts
Binary Search uses division operator to divide range. Fibonacci Search doesnâ€™t use /, but uses + and -. The division operator may be costly on some CPUs.
Fibonacci Search examines relatively closer elements in subsequent steps. So when input array is big that cannot fit in CPU cache or even in RAM, Fibonacci Search can be useful.
